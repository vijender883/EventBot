For comprehensive instructions, including API key setup, environment configuration (especially `DATABASE_URL`), running the application, deployment, and troubleshooting, please see our [Detailed Installation and Setup Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Running the Backend

To run the FastAPI backend server:
```bash
make run-backend
# Alternatively: uvicorn app:app --reload
```
The backend will typically start on `http://localhost:8000` (FastAPI's default) or `http://localhost:5000` if configured.

### Running the Frontend

To run the Streamlit frontend application:
1.  Ensure the backend is running.
2.  Set the `ENDPOINT` environment variable if your backend is not on `http://localhost:5000`. For local development, you can add `ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000` (or your backend's port) to your `.env` file.
```bash
make run-frontend
# Alternatively: streamlit run src/frontend/streamlit_app.py
```
The frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📡 API Endpoints

The API routes are primarily defined in `src/backend/routes/chat.py`. The root `/` endpoint is in `app.py`.

| Endpoint     | Method | Description                                          | Request Body (Format)         | Success Response (JSON Example)                                                                                                |
|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`          | GET    | Basic API information and available endpoints.       | N/A                           | `{"message": "PDF Assistant Chatbot API", "version": "1.0.0", "endpoints": {"/health": "GET - Health check", ...}}` (from `chat.py`) |
| `/health`    | GET    | Detailed health check of backend services.           | N/A                           | `{"status": "healthy", "services": {"manager_agent_health": {...}}, "overall_health": true}`                                   |
| `/uploadpdf` | POST   | Uploads a PDF file for processing, text vectorization (Pinecone), and table storage (MySQL). | FormData: `file` (PDF file)   | `{"success": true, "message": "PDF processed...", "filename": "name.pdf", "tables_stored": 1, "text_chunks_stored": 10}`            |
| `/answer`    | POST   | Asks a question about the processed PDF content.     | JSON: `{"query": "Your question?"}` | `{"answer": "AI generated answer.", "success": true, "error": null}`                                                                                           |

### Key Components

**Backend:**
-   **`app.py`**: Initializes the FastAPI app, loads configuration, sets up the `Orchestrator` (which initializes agents), and includes API routers.
-   **`src/backend/routes/chat.py`**: Defines API endpoints (`/health`, `/uploadpdf`, `/answer`) and delegates requests to appropriate handlers (e.g., `Orchestrator` for Q&A, `upload_pdf` util for uploads).
-   **`src/backend/services/orchestrator.py`**: Central coordinator that uses `ManagerAgent` for processing queries.
-   **`src/backend/agents/manager_agent.py`**: Core agent using LangGraph. Analyzes queries, routes them to table or RAG processing (using `ChatbotAgent`), and combines results with `CombinerAgent`.
-   **`src/backend/agents/rag_agent.py` (Class `ChatbotAgent`)**: Specialized agent for RAG, performing similarity search in Pinecone and generating answers with Gemini.
-   **`src/backend/agents/combiner_agent.py`**: Merges responses from different sources into a single, coherent answer using an LLM.
-   **`src/backend/services/embedding_service.py`**: Manages text embedding generation (Gemini) and storage/retrieval in Pinecone.
-   **`src/backend/utils/pdf_processor.py`**: Extracts text and tables from PDFs. Stores table data in MySQL.
-   **`src/backend/utils/upload_pdf.py`**: Handles the PDF upload process, coordinating `PDFProcessor` and `EmbeddingService`.
-   **`src/backend/config.py`**: Manages application configuration from environment variables.
-   **`src/backend/models.py`**: Contains Pydantic models for API request/response validation.

**Frontend:**
-   **`src/frontend/streamlit_app.py`**: A Streamlit application providing the user interface. It interacts with the backend API.

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. These are typically defined in a `.env` file in the project root for local development. See `.env.template` for a list of required variables.

**Backend Variables:**
-   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key.
-   `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key.
-   `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: The name of your Pinecone index.
-   `PINECONE_DIMENSION`: The dimension of vectors for Pinecone (e.g., 768 for `models/embedding-001`).
-   `PINECONE_CLOUD`: The cloud provider for your Pinecone index (e.g., `aws`).
-   `PINECONE_REGION`: The region of your Pinecone index (e.g., `us-east-1`).
-   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your MySQL database (e.g., `mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@host:port/database`). **This is new and critical for table storage.**
-   `APP_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`.
-   `PORT`: Port for the backend server (defaults to `8000` or `5000`).

**Frontend Variables:**
-   `ENDPOINT`: The URL of the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

## 🧪 Running Tests

*(This section outlines general steps. Specific test setup might vary.)*

For information on installing test dependencies, see the [Detailed Installation and Setup Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md#-running-tests).

3.  **Run Tests**: Navigate to the project root directory and execute:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    Pytest will automatically discover and run tests (typically files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` in the `tests/` directory).

Refer to the `tests/` directory and any specific test documentation or configuration files for more detailed instructions on running tests.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting common installation and setup issues, refer to the [Detailed Installation and Setup Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md#-troubleshooting).

### Debug Mode (Local Development)

For more verbose error output locally:
1.  Set `APP_ENV=development` in your `.env` file. This often enables FastAPI's debug mode.
2.  Optionally, set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `.env` for more detailed application logs.
3.  Run the app (e.g., `uvicorn app:app --reload`).

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Checks

The `/health` endpoint (see [API Endpoints](#-api-endpoints)) provides detailed status of backend components, including the different agents. Regularly polling this endpoint can help ensure system availability.

### Logs

-   **Local Development**: Logs are output to the console where `uvicorn app:app` is running. Adjust `LOG_LEVEL` in `.env` for desired verbosity.
-   **Render Deployment**: Access and monitor logs via the Render dashboard for your service. This is crucial for diagnosing issues in the production environment.

Key information to look for in logs:
-   Successful/failed PDF uploads and processing durations (including table and text chunk counts).
-   Question answering request details, including routing decisions by `ManagerAgent`.
-   Errors from external services (Gemini, Pinecone, MySQL).
-   Any unexpected application exceptions or tracebacks.

## 🔒 Security

-   **API Keys & Database Credentials**: Handled via environment variables (`.env` locally, Render's environment settings). Never hardcode credentials. Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
-   **File Uploads**:
    *   `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` is used to sanitize filenames.
    *   File type and size are validated as per `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` and `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in the app configuration.
-   **Input Validation**: Pydantic models (`src/backend/models.py`) are used for request validation in API endpoints.
-   **SQL Injection**: Use of SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries by `PDFProcessor` helps mitigate SQL injection risks when interacting with MySQL. Ensure any direct SQL construction is done safely.
-   **CORS**: FastAPI handles CORS through `CORSMiddleware`. Ensure it's configured securely, especially in production, by specifying allowed origins, methods, and headers. For example:
    ```python
    from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["https://your.frontend.domain.com"], # Or ["*"] for development
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    ```
-   **Error Handling**: FastAPI has built-in support for returning structured JSON error responses (e.g., using `HTTPException`) and allows for custom exception handlers. This helps avoid exposing raw stack traces.
-   **Dependency Management**: Keep `requirements.txt` up-to-date. Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit` or GitHub's Dependabot.
-   **HTTPS**: Render automatically provides HTTPS for deployed services.
